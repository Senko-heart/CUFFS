# CUFFS

CUFFS is a base implementation of core functions for creation of ADV-type text and graphics novels, inspired by famous games made for Gothic Lolita game engine.

This repository does not provide game assets, and isn't suited for any type of game out of the box. You should provide your own assets and make modifications suitable to your own project.

The project is made in Godot 4.5.1. Godot versions will be updated as necessary.
